This is my submission for Cloudflare's Full-Stack Internship-2020 Challenge.

The index.js file contains the logic for sending users to one of two webpages randomly using Cloudflare Workers API.

I have implemented all 3 Requirements as well as all 2 Extra Credit tasks. I have not published to a domian as I do not own one. Instead I have deployed the website to Cloudflare's workers.dev subdomain. Please click the below link to go to the website.

https://my-router-app.ardagon.workers.dev

I have removed my account_id from wrangler.toml file.

Thank you for considering my submission for the challenge.
